My Goals in this blog are to document my progress on developing firmware for various embedded platforms. My personal favourite is the RPi Pico series.

RP2040 and RP3050 are ARM-Cortex M0+ chips with PIO (ASM-made high speed communication protocols), Wifi Capabilities, etc.

I have interest in using the RPi Pico to make a non-emulator gaming platform, for IOT Projects/Sockets (leverage CYW-43 infastructure) and general robotics skills developments.

Sockets in Particular are very interesting to me, as they are the majaor building block behind all web applications. 
Being proficcient in debugging and building sockets leads to strong backend developer skills and a solid understanding of internet protocols, multi-threaded systems, and client-server architecture.

I hope to update this blog at least 2 times a month to showcase & store breakthroughs I make on developing my projects.
