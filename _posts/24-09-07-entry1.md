I've been watching too many Al Pacino movies.

I am glad that there is free-to-use infastructure like github sites available for me to use in order to document stuff.
I've also *been* getting into pixel art as a means of relaxation, although I'm not a very good pixel artist (yet).
I have a good idea for what i'm going to do with it too; Make a pixel art cover for my lofi jazz album.
Making Lofi Jazz is quite hard; It's hard enough to improvize blues (which i just started recently)
But I haven't made any real music with my Reaper & MPK Mini. However I've got time to build all that out, and it is just a hobby, after all. I understand the basics and I'd love to build out more, but sometimes it seems my focus is on building other things, like my web sockets project.
To be honest, I spend even longer on my gaming escapades. I can't even begin to imagine how much time i've spent shirking my duties so i can play League of Legends. 

I'd much rather spend that time doing stuff like this if it means that I can have a strong portfolio, a team of people who can rely on me, i can rely on them. I should work towards being that kind of person rather than distracting myself with games to avoid the stress of the tech job market, whatever's going on on the news, daily agitations.
I have to believe that there's a way for me to succeed, despite what my instincts and my doubts may tell me.
