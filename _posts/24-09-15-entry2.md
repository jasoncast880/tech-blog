Today is a dev evening for the rp2040 project, pockpet. (name pending)

I have been developing the rp2040 with a tft screen for quite some time, and over that course of time, I've come into lots of issues when it comes to how to fix issues that arise; print debbugging libraries like <errno.h> have been somewhat helpful, but I have read and seen elsewhere that embedded debuggers like gdb are industry standard for bug fixing and general engineering tooling. 
I should stop avoiding using debuggers just because I'm not familiar with the technology, and embrace something that could increase my productivity and effectiveness. 

Thus, My Goals for today are to build a debugger rig using the [rp2040 debugger](https://github.com/raspberrypi/debugprobe).

Update: i got sleepy, I'm going to continue my openocd-gdb tommorow.
